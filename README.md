Machine Failure Prediction

Description:
A predictive model designed to anticipate potential machine failures using real-world sensor data. The model applies supervised learning techniques to detect early signs of malfunction and prevent costly downtime.

Tech Stack:

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering for noisy sensor data.

Model evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization of performance metrics for better interpretability.

Results:

Achieved over 95% accuracy in failure detection.

Improved maintenance scheduling by predicting potential breakdowns in advance.

Outcome:
Provided a data-driven approach for preventive maintenance and operational efficiency.
